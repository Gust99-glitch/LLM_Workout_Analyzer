Introduction
Thank you for reading this free download version of the StewSmith.com basic
fitness and health routine. This 45 day program is specifically designed for a
beginner to exercise or someone who is rehabilitating after an injury. For the
purposes of this program, a “beginner” is someone who cannot do regular
pushups at all or properly, cannot walk a mile in under 12 minutes, or has not
exercised in several years. The goals of this program are to help you develop
foundational fitness and cardiovascular base you will need to get more fit, lose
weight, and reach your goals. Follow up programs are available and will
prepare you for the next level of fitness, BUT if you are going to do this ebook
workout, you should have two goals to accomplish:
1. Build a foundation of fitness and/ or
2. Lose Weight
This is a great first time to exercise for younger children as well as for those
who have neglected personal fitness for several years. Please take a few
minutes to look through the whole book so that you become familiar with all
the program components.

Do You Have Time to Exercise??
Do you really not have enough time in your day to exercise? Too many times
people say, “I need to exercise but I do not have enough time in the day.” Or,
when they do have the time they only have the energy to lie down and watch
TV. Whether you are on travel working late hours or at home dealing with
work, family, and other after school events, the schedule below or some
version of it will help you get over the hump.
Exercise is anything other than sleeping or sitting. Even when you are on the
floor flat on your back or stomach you can exercise the torso with abdominal
exercise or back other torso exercises. The pushup is a great “laying down”
exercise and an abdominal crunch is just a little bit harder than sleeping. An
hour a day is a nice goal to achieve to increase your fitness level and overall
health, but even 10-15 minutes is better than nothing and beneficial too.

Fitting fitness into a day is a challenge we all face. Exercising is tough after
long hours of working at home, office or on the road, but Americans still need
to workout as we are creating a generation of people who are obese and have
other PREVENTABLE health disorders. Many people who struggle to fit
fitness into their schedule actually do a better job at getting the job done IF
they take 15-20 minutes prior to starting work for the day and 15-20 minutes
after work is done for the day. Even if that exercise is a simple walk before
breakfast and after dinner, a 15-20 minute walk at each of these times can
significantly help you burn calories that only wind up getting stored as fat. In
fact, after any meal, a light walk and some calisthenics will help you to be
more energized and ready to do whatever.
Here is a busy day schedule I typically do when long days appear:
0600 – Early wake up for get 20-30 minutes of some form of cardio done like
running, biking, swimming. If on the road, find a pool in a hotel to really wake
up for the day.
0700 – Eat Breakfast for energy for the day. (See Lean Down Food Plan)
0800 – Work
1000 – Work - Eat a snack
1230 – Eat lunch
1:15 – Walk a few minutes
1:30 – Work
4:00 – Work – Eat a snack
6:00 – Break for dinner
7:00 – Walk or Lift weights or PT for second wind of the long day
8:00 – Continue work until midnight if needed
Personally, when I have to work 15-18 hour days, I like to get a cardio workout
completed the first thing in the morning. This wakes me up fully and I am
ready to handle the day ahead. Then, eat a good breakfast full of protein,
carbohydrates, and plenty of water. Then pack a snack for about mid morning
like an apple, orange, yogurt or a nutrition bar. This will help you from being
a ravenous eater at lunch if eating in a restaurant. For lunch have a green leafy
salad with some form of lean meat like chicken or fish or boiled eggs. Then,
take a 10-15 minute walk to help keep the metabolism going for the afternoon.
Afternoon working is much easier if you lay off the breads, simple sugars and
focus on eating protein, complex carbohydrates and fiber rich foods.
After working the rest of the day, break for a medium sized dinner and try to
squeeze in a short workout of weights, calisthenics or if you do not have those
facilities, just walk again. But, I find a lifting session or PT really gives me the
second wind I need to keep working or playing with the family.
I hope these tips will be of use to you as they are common issues seen today.
Remember something is better than nothing so at least get out and walk a few
times a day
The Five Phases of Fitness (Psychological)
Below are the five phases we all go through when starting a new fitness
program no matter what fitness level we are.
1) Make a decision to get healthy...This takes 3-4 seconds but it takes about 2-
3 weeks to make a habit - hang in there at least that long...and BUILD GOOD
HABITS.
2) You doubt yourself. It is absolutely natural to have doubts about what you
are undertaking. My advice is to start doubting yourself as quickly as possible
and get over it. Realize self doubt is part of the process...Even SEAL trainees
doubt themselves, but those who become SEALs conquer their doubt.
3) Conquer Doubt - You can do anything you set your mind to. That is what
you just told yourself. This is where the mind and body connect. Use the
workouts to be a catalyst in all areas of your life: work, relationships, school,
etc...I am a firm believer that exercising your body will give you the stamina
and energy to exercise your mind spirit and build better relationships with
those around you...
4) Associate yourself with fit and healthy people. Now you are fit in mind and
body. Your example will inspire others. Be a role model to another heavy
person. People will be amazed by your new work ethic and work and play.
Eating healthy is now a habit for you too...In fact eating crappy food makes
you feel ill slightly..
5) Set and conquer a goal for yourself. Whatever you like - run, swim bike
weight lift...Challenge yourself to run a 10k, lift 400 lbs etc...
The Father Hoog Story
Motivation To Change Your Life –
From Overweight to Healthy
Changing your life and deciding to do something different because you yearn
to is something you read about, but I am here to tell you it can happen to you at
any time in your life. Most of us all say to ourselves, "One day, I'd like to do
that."
One day two men meet for the first time. One, a 52 year old Catholic priest and
the other a 28 year old Navy SEAL Lieutenant. The two could never have
foreseen the effect they would have on each others lives. I personally know
first hand because I am Stew Smith, the Navy SEAL lieutenant.
The priest, Father Hoog, who was from St. Mary's in Annapolis, waited at his
table at the Naval Academy Restaurant. I was stationed at the Naval Academy
and in charge of the remedial physical fitness program at the time, so I was
accustomed to talking to people about fitness. But never had I undertaken such
a project. Father Hoog's goal was to become a Navy Chaplain after almost 25
years as a civilian Catholic priest. I knew this was not going to be easy to
accomplish and I figured I would put as much into his program as Father Hoog
did.
Our first visit, was spent getting to know each other and I soon found myself
talking about my choice to convert to Catholicism. The first meeting went well
as we discovered we both could contribute to each other's lives. We decided
that we would meet weekly to exercise and my job was to alter his weekly
fitness program to meet the goals specified by the Navy. In turn Father Hoog
helped me find faith in the Catholic Church and God. He was always willing to
answer my basic questions about Catholicism and faith.
Father Hoog had to lose over eighty pounds, be able to do over 40 pushups, 60
situps and run a mile and a half under 13:00. The first week, we took a
benchmark test to see where he should begin. Father Hoog could walk a mile,
but not run at all. Pushups on his toes, which was the requirement, were
nonexistent and his weak lower back was preventing him from being able to do
situps. His high blood pressure was an issue as well and he was on medication
for it.
Week one for Father Hoog was a week of walking, stretching, a few knee
pushups and crunches. Everyday, I would see Father Hoog walking around the
Naval Academy Campus. It was good to see he was determined to start, but
would he keep up the vigor? We also realized that he had to watch the sweets,
but decided not to start a rigorous diet the same week as an exercise routine.
Exercise to a sedentary person is stressful enough, I did not want to add to the
stress, so we decided to wait a month or so before we added a strict diet
program. We tripled his water intake, for if there is such thing as a magic
solution to losing weight it is WATER. He was drinking nearly a gallon a day
and barely able to make it through an entire mass without rushing to the rest
room. But the water helped flush his system, enabled the body to burn fat as an
energy source more efficiently, and kept his body cool during exercise.
Within a few weeks, father Hoog showed no signs of weight loss and was
getting frustrated. He was building muscle in areas that were inactive before,
but he was losing fat at the same time. Father Hoog did not notice the change
in body composition by the scale, but he did notice by the tape measure and the
tighter notch on his belt. This was pleasing to both of us, but we still had 75
pounds to go.
Two months into the fitness program, we decided to start monitoring food
intake. I made him write down everything he put into his mouth. This proved to
be the area where he needed the most help and the documentation of every
piece of candy in between meals helped him realize that. Soon he had given up
M&Ms, cookies and other sugary snacks for apples, oranges and other fruits.
The water consumption helped out in this area as well, for most people confuse
hunger with dehydration. A quart of water during the late morning and
afternoon helped curb his appetite for lunch and afternoon snacking. It all
made sense to him as I mentioned these tips, but changing dietary habits that
are 50 years old is as challenging as beginning an exercise program. But Father
Hoog was well on his way physically, so I started to have as much faith as he
had determination. This was the month that his doctor reduced the high blood
pressure medicine as well. So we were making progress. "You do not get out
of shape overnight, you can't expect to get back into shape overnight either." I
told him. So with that, he shifted into long term mode, which took off the stress
on weigh in days.
At the sixth month, we had seen much progress. Father Hoog was now running
with me for a few miles, then walking a bit in between. Father Hoog started
running by just completing 50 yards at a time then walking 50 yards to catch
his breath. We repeated this several time during the run / walk. This workout
seemed to help rejuvenate the metabolism and melted nearly fifty pounds of
Father Hoog away by Spring. It is not easy losing fifty pounds during the
winter months, most people in the Northeast gain weight since it is colder
outside and fewer activities available. But Father Hoog was now weighing just
230 pounds, could run the mile and a half in the prescribed time and pass the
pushup and situps test. Our calisthenics program had paid off. Hundreds of
repetitions of pushups, crunches, squats and even pullups and dips, helped
Father Hoog add the strength he needed to pass the Navy Physical Fitness
Standards for a fifty year old man. Now it was a battle with just thirty pounds.
And of course, Father Hoog's own battle not to just pass the standards with the
minimums, but he wanted to ace the standards and receive the highest score
possible for his age group. This appealed to the Navy SEAL in me naturally, I
always disregarded the minimum scores and only saw the maximums as goals.
I was amazed! He was still determined to keep on pressing. Accomplishing the
physical fitness testing goals were a big relief for us both, but we had no idea
how hard the next thirty pounds would be.
It was about Easter time now, eight months into Father Hoog's mission of
becoming a Navy Chaplain and my mission of becoming Catholic. All along,
Father Hoog helped straighten out the Catholics churches views on many
controversial topics as well as explain the basics. I was able to do my first
Confession with Father Hoog during the Easter week services and I soon was
Catholic. My wife and I took the RCIA classes together, but she was born
Catholic. It was good for both of us, especially since I surprised her one day
almost a year earlier with the announcement I wanted to become Catholic.
The ninth month was depressing. It was the third month in a row on little or no
weight loss. Father Hoog only lost five pounds in three months. With twenty
five pounds to go, we had to change something to stimulate more weight loss.
Father Hoog was stuck on a plateau, so I pushed him off with a course of
weight training, more running, swimming and biking. This was the boost
Father Hoog needed. Not only did these add challenges to his physical fitness
program, it changed to tone of the workouts as well. The workouts were not
easier, just different.
The change in pace seemed to work. After another two months, we were back
on the road to losing weight steadily. Only fifteen more pounds to go. Now
Father Hoog's running had skyrocketed to as many as ten miles nonstop. He
could do ten pullups, over 60 pushups and 75 situps. Father Hoog well
surpassed the maximum scores for his age group. He was now chasing the age
group of Navy men ten years younger than him.
Then the day came! The day we stepped on the scales and he had lost all the
weight he needed to lose. The scales tipped at a "lean, mean, preaching
machine" of 200 pounds. We jumped, we hugged, we cried and thanked God.
It was a moment I will never forget, in fact it has changed my life in many
ways.
Two months later, the Navy came to St. Mary's in Annapolis. The church held
a ceremony for Father Hoog and I was the Naval Officer who got to swear
Father Hoog into the Naval Chaplain Corp. This was an especially happy
month for me. My wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Mary Elizabeth.
Father Hoog was one of the first guests we had that day and Mary received her
first blessing. Once again, Father Hoog impressed upon me that faith and love
were as much a part of his life as hard nose determination. The Navy needed a
man like Father Hoog and now has him.
I was addicted - addicted to that feeling of helping people reach their personal
goals. I am now out of the Navy and started a fitness consultant business as
well as freelance writing. I now have four fitness books published in the past
three years. All using the same principles that I used with Father Hoog. In fact,
my most recent book was dedicated to Father Hoog - Maximum Fitness. It
features a 52 week workout program, nutritional chapter as well as hundreds of
pictures to show beginners how to do the exercises properly. I also write a
weekly fitness column for Military.com and have my own website -
www.StewSmith.com , which is dedicated to helping people reach their fitness
goals.

Getting Started
The following stretching plan will assist you with getting started again
safely and without as much post-exercise soreness.
Too many people above the age of 30 get injured no matter what they
are doing. From shoveling snow, a pick-up basketball game and simply
walking across a parking lot in winter, most injuries are strains or
muscle pulls that can be prevented with a few simple stretching
exercises done daily. The added flexibility will not only assist in
injury prevention, but with speed workouts, better enable you to run
faster. The following is a stretching routine that can be used whether
you are a beginner or advanced athlete.
The Television Workout Option:
Did you know that there are 10 minutes of commercials for every 30
minute TV show? If you watch TV for an hour and exercise during the
commercials, you can actually receive 20 minutes of metabolism
charging exercise. See the TV Option Workout in the back or buy the
TV Watcher’s Workout for the complete Twelve Week plan.
The Stretching Program
Increasing one’s flexibility should be the first goal before
starting a fitness program. In fact, if you are thinking about beginning
a fitness program and you have been idle for many years, you should
stretch for an entire week prior to starting running, lifting weights, or
doing any calisthenics exercise. It is OK to walk to warm up however.
So, your first 1-2 weeks of starting a fitness program should consist of
the following stretches 1-2 times a day, drinking 2-3 liters of water a
day, and walking, biking or some other non-impact low intensity cardio
activity for 10-15 minutes.
Follow the stretching chart after your workout. Hold these
stretches or do these movements for at least 15-20 seconds each:
Shoulder Shrugs
Chest / Bicep Stretch
Arm/Shoulder Stretch
Tricep/Back Stretch (half moon)
Stomach Stretch
Lowerback Stretch
ITB / Hip
Calf Stretch
Hamstring Stretch
Thigh Stretch - standing of laying on floor
Stretch in this order to aid in major muscle group stretching.
Stretching the connecting groups of the thighs and hamstrings first will
assist in a more thorough stretch of the hams and thighs – the major
muscle groups of the body.
Stretching and Warming Up
Holding these stretches for 15-20 seconds is the best way to end your
workout. Do not bounce when performing these stretches and inhale
deeply for three seconds, hold for three seconds and fully exhale. Do
this twice per stretch. This will take you to the 15-20 second time
minimum for holding these stretches for optimal results.
Explanations of the Stretches
Arm / Shoulder Circles - Rotate your shoulders slowly in big circles forward
and reverse for 15 seconds each direction and as if you were swimming the
backstroke and front crawl stroke.
Chest / Shoulder / Upper Back Stretch – Grab onto pole or wall and twist
opposite of your arm until you feel the stretch in your chest and shoulder
connection. Repeat with the other arm. Option two the swimmer stretch: If
you can grab your hands behind your back and pull your shoulders back
standing upright with chest out. Then role the shoulders forward and take chin
to chest.
Arm Shoulder stretch – Grab arm with opposite arm and pull it across the
body stretching the rear shoulder and upperback. Rotate hands with thumbs
down.
Shoulder rotations: This movement helps warm up the rotator cuff of the
shoulder joint and is a great one to do if you are about the throw a ball or just
need to work on full range of motion of the shoulder.
Torso Twists: Stay in the same position but now twist to the left and right
trying to keep your hips facing forward.
Triceps into Back Stretch - Place both arms over and behind your head.
Grab your right elbow with your left hand and pull your elbow toward your
opposite shoulder. Lean with the pull. Repeat with the other arm.
Abdominal Stretch - Lie on your stomach. Push yourself up to your elbows.
Slowly lift your head and shoulders and look up at the sky or ceiling. Hold for
15 seconds and repeat two times.
Lowerback Stretch #1 – Cat Stretch – Get on all fours as shown and bow
your back. Try to take your head as close to your shoulders as possible. Put
your chin to your chest and hold for 10 seconds.
Lowerback Stretch #2 Lie on your left side. Place your top leg in front of
you. Slowly twist your torso until your shoulders touch the floor. Hold for 15
seconds and repeat on the right side.
As you may know, the lower back is the most commonly injured area of the
body. Many lower back problems stem from inactivity, lack of flexibility, and
improper lifting of heavy objects. Stretching and exercising your lower back
will help prevent some of those injuries.
Hip / outer thigh stretch – Sit down with your left leg crossed over your right
leg. Grab the left leg with both hands around the thigh / shin (with leg bent)
and pull toward your chest / then twist. Repeat with the other leg.
Calf Stretch into Achilles Tendon Stretch - Stand with one foot 2-3 feet in
front of the other. With both feet pointing in the same direction as you are
facing, put most of your body weight on your leg that is behind you - stretching
the calf muscle.
Now, bend the rear knee slightly. You should now feel the stretch in your heel.
This stretch helps prevent Achilles tendonitis, a severe injury that will sideline
most people for about 4-6 weeks.
Down Dog Pose – Stretch the back of the legs and lowerback with this
relaxing yoga pose. Hold for 15-30 seconds Try to keep your heels on the
floor.
Hamstring Stretch - From the standing or sitting position, bend forward at the
waist and touch your toes. Keep your back straight and slightly bend your
knees. You should feel this stretching the back of your thighs.
Thigh Stretch Standing - Standing, bend your knee and grab your foot at the
ankle. Pull your heel to your butt and push your hips forward. Squeeze your
butt cheeks together keep your knees close together. Hold for 10-15 seconds
and repeat with the other leg.( You can hold onto something for balance if you
need to OR you can lie down on your hip and perform this stretch.
Tender Shin Exercises: If you get shin splints from running or walking, here
are two great exercises to build your shins. Stand on your heels for 10-15
seconds. Repeat a few times and even throughout the day to build your shins.
Prior to walking and running, do the foot flex / stretch exercise (2/3 pics) 30-
40 times each leg.
Heel walk Foot flex Foot stretch
Descriptions and pictures of the exercises
Regular and knee Push-ups - Lie on the ground with your hands placed flat
next to your chest. Your hands should be about shoulder width apart. Push
yourself up by straightening your arms and keeping your back stiff. This
exercise will build and firm your shoulders, arms, and chest. Use your knees
if necessary to complete the repetitions in the workout.
Assisted Push-ups - Using a piece of furniture to place your hands 3-4 feet off
the ground, lean into the furniture or wall. Straighten your arms, back, hips,
and legs and push yourself off of the firmly placed piece of furniture. Bend
your arms so that your chest touches the furniture. Repeat as required. This is
a great way to start out if you cannot do any push-ups at all.
Bench Dips -Sit on a chair, bench or small table. Place your feet about three
feet in front of you as you sit on the very edge of the seat. Now, grab the edge
of the seat with your hands, lift your butt off the seat and lower yourself about
4-5 inches below the seat by bending your arms at the elbow.
Lower body Exercises
Squats - Keep your feet shoulder width apart. Drop your butt back as though
sitting in a chair. Concentrate on squeezing your glutes in your upward motion.
Keep your heels on the ground and keep your shins should be near vertical at
all times. Extend your buttocks backward. Do not keep your buttocks over
your feet and extend your knees over your feet. This picture is a half squat – if
you can go down lower without pain then do so.
The 1/2 squat - Intensify your squat by doing 1/2 squats. While in the full
squat position, hold the pose and push yourself up and down within a 6” range
of motion....just like riding a horse.
Walking squats - This is a regular squat but you add a side hop to it. Squat
down in a full squat position. When pushing yourself upward, shuffle your feet
to the left or right. Each step, stop and do a full squat. You can alternate left
and right steps if you do not have much room or you can do 10 side squats to
the left across a room then 10 side squats to the right back to your starting
place.
Walking Lunge - The lunge is a great leg exercise to develop shape and
flexibility. Keep your chest up high and your stomach tight. Take a long step
forward and drop your back knee toward the ground. Standup on your forward
leg, bringing your feet together and repeat with the other leg. Make sure your
knee never extends past your foot. Keep your shin vertical in other words.
Muscles used: quadriceps, hams, and gluteus.
Stationary Lunge - Take a big stride forward. Bend both knee as you lower
yourself so your front thigh is near parallel to the floor. Lift yourself up so
your knees are straight but your feet have remained in the same position. If
you have bad knees either avoid the lunge exercise or only go half way down.
Abdominals
When you exercise your stomach muscles, make sure to exercise and
stretch your back also. The stomach and lower back muscles are opposing
muscle groups and if one is much stronger than the other, then you can injure
the weaker muscle group easily - usually the lower back.
Regular Crunch - Lie on your back with your feet and knees in the air with
the knees bent. Cross your hands over your chest and bring your elbows to
your knees by flexing your stomach. Keep your feet on the floor if your lower
back is weak or previously injured.
Reverse Crunch - In the same position as the regular crunch, lift your knees
and butt toward your elbows. Leave your head and upper body flat on the
ground. Only move your legs and butt.
Right Elbow to Left Knee - Cross your left leg over your right leg. Flex your
stomach and twist to bring your right elbow to your left knee.
Left Elbow to Right Knee - Cross your right leg over your leg. Flex your
stomach and twist to bring your left elbow to your right knee.
Double Crunch - (Legs up) - Lie on your back with your feet in the air. Cross
your hands over your chest and bring your elbows to your knees by flexing
your stomach AND lift your hips off the floor as if you were doing a reverse
crunch. This is two crunches in one movement. (Do not do if you have
previous lower back injury)
Bicycle Crunches – (Lovehandles)- Peddle your legs back and forth as shown
while doing left and right crunches. This is a tough one so if you back hurts
stop and save until your back is stronger.
LOWER BACK EXERCISES
These exercises are to be done immediately following any large set of
abdominals in order to balance out the torso with the opposing muscle group of
the abdominals / lower back. You will find that a strong lower back will assist
you in completing long load bearing hikes.
Plank Pose – Another great yoga pose to safely strengthen your stomach and
lower back. Hold for as long as you can and build up to 1-2 minutes over time.
Prone Lower Back Exercise #1 - Lie on your stomach with your arms
extended over your head. Lift your right arm and your left leg off the ground
at the same time and repeat for specified number of repetitions. Switch
arms/legs and repeat.
Upperback exercise - (reverse pushups) - Lie on your stomach in the down
pushup position. Lift your hands off the floor 2-3 inches instead of pushing the
floor. This will strengthen your upperback muscles that oppose the chest
muscles.
Upperback exercise #3 – (Birds) Lie on your stomach with your arms spread
to the height of your shoulders. Lift both arms off the floor until your shoulder
blades “pinch” and place them slowly in the down position. Repeat for 10-15
repetitions mimicking a bird flying.
The light weight shoulder workout – See Shoulder Workout in Workout
chart…refer to these six exercises…
Do the follow sequence of exercises non-stop for ten reps each:
Lateral Raises – 10 (palms down)
Lateral Raises – 10 (thumbs up)
Lateral Raises – 10 (thumbs down)
Front Raises – 10 (thumbs up)
Cross overs – 10 (palms facing away from you)
Military press – 10
LATERAL RAISE
A safe and effective shoulder exercise with light weights or NO weights as
well. Over 5 pound dumbbells is not recommended for this exercise. Keep
your knees slightly bent, shoulder back, and your chest high. Lift weights
parallel to ground in a smooth controlled motion, keep your palms facing the
ground. Follow the next SIX exercises without stopping.
THUMBS UP - After performing 10 regular lateral raises, do 10 lateral raises
with your thumbs up, touching your hips with your palms facing away from
you and raising your arms no higher than shoulder height.
THUMBS UP / DOWN - Continue with side lateral raises. As you lift your
arms upward, keep your thumbs up. Once your arms are shoulder height, turn
your hands and make your thumbs point toward the floor. Repeat for 10 times,
always leading in the up and down direction with your thumbs.
FRONT RAISE (THUMBS UP) - Now, for 10 more repetitions, time to
work your front deltoids. Lift the dumbbells from your waist to shoulder
height keeping your thumbs up.
CROSS OVERS - With your palms facing away from you and arms relaxed
in front of your hips, bring your arms up and over your head as if you were
doing a jumping jack (without jumping). Cross your arms IN FRONT of your
head and bring them back to your hips for 10 repetitions.
MILITARY PRESS
Place one foot ahead of the other as shown and knees slightly bent to reduce
strain on your lower back. Exhale as you push the weights over your head for
10 final repetitions in the mega-shoulder pump workout.. Slowly lower them to
shoulder height and repeat. Muscles used are shoulders and triceps (back of
arm).
Dumbbell Exercises
Biceps Curls
Place dumbbells or bar in hands with your palms facing upward. Use a
complete range of motion and keep it smooth. Do not swing the weights.
Nothing moves but your elbows. Muscles used: biceps (arms).
Hammer Curls
This is the same as a bicep curls except your palms are facing your hips.
Alternate lifting each dumbbells like you were running - "hip to lip". Use a
complete range of motion and keep it smooth. Do not swing the weights.
Tricep Extensions- (Back of the arm)
With weights in hands, bring your hands overhead and lower the weight toward
the back of your neck. Make certain your elbows remain in one place through
movement – next to your ears!. Repeat!
Weight Loss Help:
The following pages contain light reading concerning diet, nutrition, water
intake and exercise. Over the next week, I recommend you to keep exercising
and stretching. Also notice the caloric values charts attached and just how
much exercise is required to “burn off” certain foods. The amount of exercise
required to do this may deter you from eating that extra helping or midday
snack during football games.

Exercise and Healthy Eating the First Priority
The aim of an exercise program is to lose fat without losing muscle and
without reducing metabolic rate. The exercise needs to be customized to fitness
level and to specific goal of fat loss.
Together aerobic exercise and resistance training are the ideal combination of
exercise to achieve fat loss and it should be part of your lifestyle.
Aerobic Exercise
Aerobic exercise metabolizes calories and raises the metabolic rate. The heart
rate needs to be raised to a comfortable level for 20 - 30 minutes at least 3
times per week. By exercising aerobically, calories will be burnt at a rate of
300 + per hour depending on your weight and fitness level.
If you consider that just 1 pound of body fat has approx. 4,100 calories, then
you can get a rough idea, of just how long it will take to shed those extra
pounds permanently. Look again at how long it took to put them on, normally
years or a complete lifetime of your own bodily abuse.
Personally, I recommend that you work at a level that you know that you can
maintain for a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes. The debate comes in, when
various fitness bodies suggest training at a high heart rate 75/90 % of max, for
short periods or 55/80 % of maximum heart rate for easier longer periods.
In short try both methods, unless you are a complete beginner to fitness, in
which case I would recommend training at a steady pace for as long as
comfortably possible.
Aerobic exercise will also raise the metabolic rate for approx. 24 hours after
you have finished training. This helps to burn up extra calories and prevents
the metabolic rate declining.
Resistance (or weight) Training
Inactive people lose about 10 % of their muscle mass every 10 years after the
age of 25. However with regular resistance training it is possible to regain this
muscle mass.
Resistance training should be carried out 2-3 times per week for approx. 30
minutes. Although not generally effective as aerobic training for burning
calories, resistance training will still burn about 250-500 calories per hour and
will raise metabolic rate.
Weight training will not develop your body to resemble a body builder, but it
will create the ability to burn more calories in a 24 hour period.
Another important point is that muscle will not turn into fat, if you stop
training. The muscle tissue will naturally break down and shrink in size.
Important point because lean muscle tissue weighs more than body fat, your
actual body weight may stay the same, during the early stages of your new
lifestyle regime.
Don’t be alarmed, the weight will come of, however if it does not, your overall
ratio of body fat compared to lean muscle tissue, will certainly be in a healthier
ratio.
Try and avoid using the scales for this reason, unless they can monitor your
body fat as well, instead measure your body at various points e.g. your hips,
chest, stomach and thighs. Using an item of clothing is also a good way to
measure yourself, as with a bit of time and dedication, you will find that the
clothing fits you properly. You will at a point lose inches and stop losing
weight for about a 2-4 week period typically.
Healthy Eating
Good nutrition is very important for fat loss, and focusing on health and health
promoting foods is far more productive than focusing on fat loss and denial of
favorite foods.
Adopting a whole food diet, avoiding salt, fat, sugar, additives, preservatives,
processed and refined foods, needs to become part of a life style change.
By increasing natural foods with a high fiber and water content (fruit and
vegetables) more food can be eaten to appease the appetite without gaining
weight.
A whole food diet also has a much higher vitamin and mineral content than a
typical diet containing processed and refined foods. Dieting is such a negative
term – I like to think of it as “eating to lose weight.”
The following charts compare the caloric value and expenditure values of
different foods and activities respectively. It is important to realize just how
much work is required to burn off certain foods. For instance, to burn the
amount of calories in a chocolate chip cookie, it requires a person to walk
vigorously for over 20 minutes. A cookie has a caloric value of 110 calories.
A person must walk for a 20 minute time period to burn off that one cookie.
Below are others foods and activities to better drive home the seriousness of
watching your calories:

Post Workout Meals
The key is to replace carbohydrates and electrolytes lost
during the workout – drink Powerade / Gatorade immediately
after workout
Another important factor is to add protein to help rebuild muscles –
see above meal / snack ideas within 30 minutes of workouts
DEHYDRATION
It is easy to design a dehydration diet that results in losing 10 lb. of water
within several days. Many people are encouraged by these rapid results.
Dehydration of only 2-3 % of body weight can result in a drop in physical
performance.
Your body is over 75% water and needs this percentage to remain close to that
amount in order to function properly. Sweat is not only water, but salt and
electrolytes. These compounds help regulate nerve and muscular function.
Without them entire systems start to break down and this can be fatal. Also,
once you stop sweating, there is no mechanism in your body to regulate body
temperature and you could overheat and die from heat stroke.
Removing additional water from your digestive system by diuretics and
laxatives causes the kidneys to overwork and eventually stop functioning.
When this occurs the liver assists the body in excretion waste products (if it
can) and it stops with its primary mission of metabolizing fat as an energy
source. So in a nutshell, you shut down your entire metabolism and your body
tries desperately to cling onto any remaining water and fat. This actually can
cause the opposite desired affect – your body now is retaining water and fat
just to survive. I call this camel mode.
This process is a vicious cycle. The true way to burn fat and lose weight for
the long term is to actually drink water plus exercise. I usually drink over a
gallon of water a day but I exercise for more than two hours a day usually. I
would recommend 2-3 quarts for women and 3-4 quarts for men per day of
water to see huge results in weight loss. The equation looks like this:
Fat loss = water + oxygen (from cardio vascular exercise)
Typical and safe weight loss amounts range from 2-3 pounds per week from
using this formula. Any weight loss more than that and you are losing water
weight – which will come back as quickly as it left.
Adopting a whole food diet, avoiding salt, fat, sugar, additives, preservatives,
processed and refined foods, needs to become part of a life style change. By
increasing natural foods with a high fiber and water content (fruit and
vegetables) more food can be eaten to appease the appetite without gaining
weight.
A whole food diet also has a much higher vitamin and mineral content than a
typical diet containing processed and refined foods. Dieting is such a negative
term – I like to think of it as “eating to lose weight.” Together aerobic exercise
and resistance training are the ideal combination of exercise to achieve fat loss
and it should be part of your lifestyle.
Eliminating Macro-Nutrients?
Just as a rule - never eliminate the macro-nutrients your body needs such as
protein, carbs, or fat from your diet. There are many diets out there that play
around with these critical components of our nutrition. HOWEVER, you can
definitely LIMIT them in order to see outstanding results. Of course you
would want to accompany your eating plan with an exercise routine that had
cardio-vascular and resistance training.
BUT - For a challenging test, try to ELIMINATE sugar. This is anything with
cane sugar in it. For a short list it means soda, sweet tea / coffee, cake,
cookies, and even white bread. Only eat multi-grain bread. You can consume
your carbs from fruits and vegetables either before or after a workout. If you
are having trouble losing that final 5-10 lbs, once you have eliminated sugar,
you will see that final extra 5-10 lbs of fat / water retention around off your
belly button area if you are a man and off your hips if you are a women.
(Typical results!!!)
For instance, I like to workout first thing in the morning when I wake up. I eat
a banana and go do a variety of exercises that include running, swimming,
weights, and calisthenics. Some days if I do just cardio workout, I will skip the
banana and wait to eat after the workout. After workout, I eat a high protein
breakfast with fruits to replace lost carbs and drink water as well. For the rest
of the morning, I snack on peanuts, almonds, a fiber rich nutrition bar (no
sugar) but only a few carbs and more water.
For lunch I eat a big salad with a large protein source again like tuna or
chicken. The salad is filled with high fiber carbs like broccoli, green leafy
lettuce like romaine, onions, almonds, maybe even some strawberries to top it
off. Squirt some lemon juice or a balsamic vinegar type dressing for some
added flavor and good fats.
After lunch, I do not eat any more carbs during the day except those that come
in peanuts, almonds, and other nuts for snacks. At this point, my body will still
have enough carbs to function properly for the rest of the day. However, if you
workout in the evening, you may want to add a few pieces of fruit or
vegetables prior to exercise longer than 30 minutes.
During dinner, I have a small salad with large source of protein again. And, if I
get hungry during the after dinner hours, I drink more water and have some
peanuts, almonds or left over chicken to fill any late evening hunger needs.
This has worked for me to get rid of that last few extra pounds being carried
around the mid-section, however dropping sugar is difficult for 2-3 days. After
that it is really easy to skip the sweets and white breads. So good luck with the
last few pounds and remember to mix in any weight loss plan with a solid
fitness routine as many people find that by just adding fitness into their world
on a daily basis, they do not have to alter much of their diet. By dropping
sugar you will save money, lose extra weight, and make your dentist happy.
NOTE: - In the 45 Day Chart workout below, you will see Repeat 5-10 times -
Basically, repeat the events under the above phrase until you reach another
line. Exercises like Bike 20:00 or Crunch Cycle, fullbody stretch, or shoulder
workout ARE NOT to be repeated several times – JUST ONCE.
Walk / run / bike - 15:00 - This is your cardio exercise choice. Some people
prefer to swim, row, bike over walking or running. It is up to you. Get moving
and do something for that day. If you wish you can even pick more than one
option to do for that day and mix in a walk with a bike or a swim even.
Plank – 1:00 – you will see 1 minute next to the plank pose – try to see how
long you can hold the plank and build up to 1 minute.
The 45 Day Chart is the daily minimal amount of recommended exercise you
need to do in this workout plan. The next page after the chart is the
supplemental program and is additional exercise to assist with fat burning and
abdominal toning IF you feel like you want to continue working out in addition
to the 45 Day workout chart.

Appendix – Diet Plan Article / Chart
For this diet, the goal will be 5-6 meals a day, spaced out every
three hours. The stomach takes about three hours to empty, so try
to keep it full but never stuffed. The small meals are just enough
to keep you satisfied until your next meal. Remember, when you
skip meals your metabolism slows down and you will not burn
calories as well. Eating and exercise actually boost your
metabolism. The base of the diet will be high protein, enough
complex carbohydrates for the workouts, and low fat. If you have
your exercise routine all figured out – great. If not, one of the
eBooks from the Military.com Fitness Store, you will now have
the tools to really get lean this summer. Here are the diet
recommendations:
6:00 AM Meal 1 (this meal can have more fat because you have
all day to burn it off)
5 egg white omelet, you can throw one whole egg in for
flavor (Use a little cheese and pepper for taste) if you want add
some ground turkey breast, or vegetables)
2 slices of wheat toast or small multi grain bagel (I put low fat
peanut butter and sugar free jelly)
(The more grains in your bread the better – Nine Grain bread is a
great toast in this case)
Avoid all white breads, pasta, flour etc…
Work out! – DO cardio in the AM.
9AM Meal 2 Post workout (eat carbs now after the workout - it
helps with insulin transport and recovery)
Skim milk with banana or Oatmeal with raisins in it. (You could
even go with small portions of both if you want.
NO Fat Yogurt
(Still have a piece of fruit if you have oatmeal.)
12:00 Noon Meal 3
Ground Turkey Breast with a little cheese ( NO MAYO –
Mustard, A1 sauce, low fast salad dressing) in a Whole wheat
wrap. I often have 2 of these! (If you like peppers or vegetables
like that you can throw them in since they add no fat)
Baked Lays chips regular
Broccoli (light butter you can use the spray if you truly want to
avoid all fat)
Piece of fruit
3:00PM Meal 4
1 can of Tuna fish or egg whites here again with a multi-grain,
whole-wheat bagel / bread.
However; since most people are at work and have to have food
that is easy, settle for another wrap, yogurt, and cold carrots.
5:00 workout - Lift or calisthenics in the early evening.
Post workout Meal #5
I recommend a protein shake or bar right after workout like a
myoplex or slim fast meal replacement bar just be sure the one
you get is low in fat. If you don’t want to drink supplement
drinks, have a can of tuna with little to no mayo, or a piece of
chicken on top of a salad and a few wheat crackers and pickles
mixed in.
Dinner! Again you can have GOOD carbs here to give you energy
back, but avoid fat since you are about to lay down and go to bed
in the next few hours. The last thing you want is fat before you go
to bed because then it is simply going to be stored.
Try the Barilla Multigrain pasta. It is THE pasta to eat since it has
10 grams of protein in a serving and almost no fat. I would have
this with turkey breast in it, or lean steak, fish, or chicken breast
with a sauce of your choice, just avoid fat sauces. This way post
workout you are getting good carbs and protein. Use wheat bread
and just use garlic on it so you have healthy garlic bread.
Now your day is done – good eating mixed with 1-2 workouts.
The workouts can be as simple as walking 20-30 minutes or as
tough as triathlon training. It is up to you and your fitness level
and goals. The diet is great for any person trying to lose body fat.
Do not forget to drink WATER! See The Importance of Water
article for more details. Water is the key. Drink it before you eat -
it fills you up. Remember it takes the human body about 15-20
minutes to realize it is full so give yourself time with small
portions and you will be full. Know that you just will not feel
that way right away. I always tell myself to eat when the clock
says to eat not when my body says to eat. This way I am never
full and I am never hungry. This is a rough idea of how I eat
listed below are some other meals I would try:
Salad-chicken- no fat dressing
chicken broccoli
Multi-grain Pasta-turkey sausage-peppers (red yellow & orange)
fat free Italian dressing (a cold dish)
Turkey breast burger on wheat bread
Egg whites are always a good meal! (Egg whites are just so
healthy)
Subway roasted chicken breast avoid mayo use the honey mustard
or nothing
Tuna
Snacks: Fruits no fat yogurt vegetables.
Just check food labels and keep the fat down. I would say below
50 grams or so. The goal is eat fruits and vegetables, multi-grain
pasta and breads with chicken, lean meats, fish and avoid
processed foods as much as you can.
Like most people, I eat the same things a lot over and over and
over! It is boring but you get use to it like anything. Just get out
of the bad habits of junk food, fast food, and sugary sweets and
you will like the results. If you are diabetic or have other
medical issues, contact a doctor or registered dietician before
changing your eating habits.
Good luck to you all – if you have questions feel free to email me
at Stew@stewsmith.com – place “45 Day Beginner” in the
subject line for my organizational needs. I will answer your
emails as soon as possible.
